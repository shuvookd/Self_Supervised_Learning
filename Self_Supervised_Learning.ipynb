        "2. **Generative Approaches**: The model reconstructs missing or corrupted parts of the input.\n",

        "- **Computer Vision**: Pretraining models on large-scale image datasets before fine-tuning them for specific tasks.\n",

        "- **Healthcare**: Learning patterns in medical images or genomic sequences without requiring large amounts of labeled data.\n",
        "- **Speech Processing**: SSL is used in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker verification.\n",
        "- **Robotics**: Training robots to understand and interact with their environment through self-supervised learning."
